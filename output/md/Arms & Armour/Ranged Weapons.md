## Ranged Weapon Damage   
When determining the physical damage caused by a ranged attack, combine the [actor](/not_created.md)â€™s [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) in _ranged combat_ with the [damage type](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Arms.md) for the weapon used. Note that any [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) applied to the _ranged combat_ roll made to hit the target are not made a part of the damage roll.   
   
| Ranged Combat |  Light  | Medium  |  Heavy  |   
|:-------------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|   
|       1       | 2D + 1B | 2D + 2B | 2D + 3B |   
|       2       | 3D + 1B | 3D + 2B | 3D + 3B |   
|       3       | 4D + 1B | 4D + 2B | 4D + 3B |   
|       4       | 5D + 1B | 5D + 2B | 5D + 3B |   
|       5       | 6D + 1B | 6D + 2B | 6D + 3B |   
   
   
   
   
## Range   
While many projectiles can fly quite far, the effective range is considerably shorter - especially when in the heat of combat! When using a ranged weapon against a target beyond the effective range, apply [malus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Malus%20Dice.md) to the attack roll as per the table below.   
   
| Range  | Effective Range | 1M  | 2M  |  3M  |   
|:------ |:---------------:|:---:|:---:|:----:|   
| Short  | Up to 10 meters | 15m | 20m | 25m  |   
| Medium | Up to 20 meters | 30m | 40m | 50m  |   
| Long   | Up to 40 meters | 60m | 80m | 100m |
