_Ranged weapons_ are either _light_ or _heavy_. In general, _light_ weapons tends to be much more inconspicuous than their heavier counterparts, with _heavy_ weapons almost exclusively being of a very obvious martial nature.   
   
When determining the physical damage caused by a ranged attack, combine the [actor](/not_created.md)’s [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) in _ranged combat_ with the damage bonus for the weapon used. The number of [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) is determined by the weapon’s type and the way it is gripped. Note that any [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) applied to the _ranged combat_ roll made to hit the target are not made a part of the damage roll.

## Grip   
   
### One-handed   
The weapon makes it normal amount of damage. One-handed _light_ weapons add 1B and one-handed _heavy_ weapons add 2B. Using a one-handed grip allows the other hand to e.g. hold a [shield](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Shields.md) or another one-handed weapon.    
   
### Two-handed   
The weapon makes an additional [bonus die](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) of damage. Two-handed _light_ weapons add 2B and two-handed _heavy_ weapons add 3B to the physical damage roll.    
   
> Noomeron is using a longbow which is a _heavy_, two-handed weapon. When shooting with it, she will base the damage on her _ranged combat_ of 4 and then add 3B for a total of 8D physical damage, including the _wild die_.
