_Ranged weapons_ are either _light_, _medium_, or _heavy_. In general, _light_ weapons tends to be much more inconspicuous than their heavier counterparts, with _heavy_ weapons almost exclusively being of a very obvious martial nature.

## Grip   
   
### One-handed   
The weapon makes it normal amount of damage. This allows the other hand to e.g. hold a [shield](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Shields.md).   
   
### Two-handed   
The weapon damage is increased one level, but at most to 5.   
   
> Noomeron is using a longbow which is a two-handed weapon. When thrusting with it, she will increase the damage level of the weapon from her _ranged_ combat_ of 4 to 5 and then add the 2B for a total of 8D including the _wild die_.
