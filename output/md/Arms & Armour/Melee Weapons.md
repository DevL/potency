_Melee weapons_ are either _light_, _medium_, or _heavy_. In general, _light_ weapons tends to be much more inconspicuous than their heavier counterparts, with _heavy_ weapons almost exclusively being of a very obvious martial nature.

## Grip   
   
### One-handed   
The weapon makes it normal amount of damage. This allows the other hand to e.g. hold a [shield](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Shields.md).   
   
### Two-handed   
The weapon damage is increased one level.   
   
> Hilda of Kullsala grips her winged spear with both hands. When thrusting with it, she will increase the damage level of the weapon from 4D to 5D.    
   
### Dual Wielding   
Designate one of the weapons as the one used for the attack. If the attack misses, it may be rerolled by spending 2P. If this second attack hits, damage is done using the other weapon. Unless the actor has the [trait](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) _Dual Wielder_, one hand can at most wield a _medium_ weapon and the other no more than a _light_.   
   
> Amgus is attacked by a bandit swinging an axe and a dagger. The bandit rolls 4D for his _melee combat_ using his axe for the first attack. The strike misses, but the bandit spends 2P to reroll it. If this second strike hits, Amgus will have to attempt to resist the dagger's damage rather than that of the axe.
