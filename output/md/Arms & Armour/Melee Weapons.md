## Melee Weapon Damage   
When determining the physical damage caused by a melee attack, combine the [actor](/not_created.md)’s [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) in _melee combat_ with the [damage type](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Arms.md) for the weapon used. Note that any [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) applied to the _melee combat_ roll made to hit the target are not made a part of the damage roll.   
   
| Melee Combat |  Light  | Medium  |  Heavy  |   
|:------------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|   
|      1       | 2D + 1B | 2D + 2B | 2D + 3B |   
|      2       | 3D + 1B | 3D + 2B | 3D + 3B |   
|      3       | 4D + 1B | 4D + 2B | 4D + 3B |   
|      4       | 5D + 1B | 5D + 2B | 5D + 3B |   
|      5       | 6D + 1B | 6D + 2B | 6D + 3B |   
   
## Two-handed Melee Weapons   
When using a melee weapon with both hands, the weapon also gains the [weapon property](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Arms.md) _powerful_.   
   
> Hilda of Kullsala grips her _medium_, winged spear with both hands. When thrusting with it, she will base the damage on her _melee combat_ of 3 and add 2B for a total of 6D physical damage, including the _wild die_. If the damage roll beats her target’s _resistance_ by 5 or more, it is treated as a _massive success_, causing two _wounds_.   
   
### Dual Wielding   
Using a pair of one-handed melee weapons counts as using a two-handed weapon. Use the [damage type](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Arms.md) for the heaviest of the two weapons being wieleded.     
   
> Amgus is attacked by a raging bandit swinging an axe and a dagger, the former being a _medium_ weapon and the latter a _light_ weapon. If the bandit hits, she may add 2B to her damage roll and will cause two wounds if she beats Amgus’ _resistance_ by 5 as the pair of weapons is counted as being a two-handed _medium weapon.
