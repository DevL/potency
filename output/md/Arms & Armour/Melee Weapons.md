_Melee weapons_ are either _light_ or _heavy_. In general, _light_ weapons tends to be much more inconspicuous than their heavier counterparts, with _medium_ and _heavy_ weapons almost exclusively being of a very obvious martial nature.   
   
When determining the physical damage caused by a melee attack, combine the [actor](/not_created.md)’s [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) in _melee combat_ with the damage bonus for the weapon used. The number of [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) is determined by the weapon’s type and the way it is gripped. Note that any [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) applied to the _melee combat_ roll made to hit the target are not made a part of the damage roll.

## Grip   
   
### One-handed   
The weapon makes it normal amount of damage. One-handed _medium_ weapons add 1B and one-handed _heavy_ weapons add 2B. This allows the other hand to e.g. hold a [shield](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Shields.md) or another one-handed weapon.    
   
### Two-handed   
The weapon makes an additional [bonus die](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) of damage. Two-handed _light_ weapons add 1B, two-handed _medium_ weapons add 2B, and two-handed _heavy_ weapons add 3B.    
   
> Hilda of Kullsala grips her _medium_, winged spear with both hands. When thrusting with it, she will base the damage on her _melee combat_ of 3 and add 2B for a total of 6D physical damage, including the _wild die_.   
   
### Dual Wielding   
Using a pair of _light_ weapons counts as using a _light_ weapon two-handed. Add 1B to the damage roll.    
   
Using a pair of _medium_ weapons or combining a _medium_ with a _light_ weapon is treated as using a _medium_ weapon two-handed. Add 2B to the damage roll.   
   
Using a pair of _heavy_ weapons or combining a _heavy_ with a _medium_ or _light_ weapon is treated as using a _heavy_ weapon two-handed. Add 3B to the damage roll.   
   
> Amgus is attacked by a raging bandit swinging an axe and a dagger, the former being a _medium_ weapon and the latter a _light_ weapon. If the bandit hits, she may add 2B to her damage roll as the pair of weapons is counted as being a two-handed _medium_ weapon.
