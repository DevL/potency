_Melee weapons_ are either _light_ or _heavy_. In general, _light_ weapons tends to be much more inconspicuous than their heavier counterparts, with _heavy_ weapons almost exclusively being of a very obvious martial nature.

## Grip   
   
### One-handed   
The weapon makes it normal amount of damage. One-handed _light_ weapons add 1B and one-handed _heavy_ weapons add 2B. This allows the other hand to e.g. hold a [shield](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Shields.md).    
   
### Two-handed   
The weapon makes an additional [bonus die](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) of damage. Two-handed _light_ weapons add 2B and two-handed _heavy_ weapons add 3B.    
   
> Hilda of Kullsala grips her _light_, winged spear with both hands. When thrusting with it, she will base the damage on her _melee combat_ of 3 and add 2B for a total of 6D physical damage, including the _wild die_.   
   
### Dual Wielding   
Using a pair of _light_ weapons counts as using a _light_ weapon two-handed. Add 2B to the damage roll.    
   
Using a pair of _heavy_ weapons or combining a _heavy_ and a _light_ weapons is treated as using a _heavy_ weapon two-handed. Add 3B to the damage roll.   
   
> Amgus is attacked by a raging bandit swinging an axe and a dagger, the former being a _heavy_ weapon and the latter a _light_ weapon. If the bandit hits, she may add 3B to her damage roll as the pair of weapons are counted as being a two-handed _heavy_ weapon.
