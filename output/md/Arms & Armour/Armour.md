_Armour_ is either _light_, _medium_, or _heavy_. In general, _light_ armour tends to be much more inconspicuous than its heavier counterparts, with _heavy_ armour almost exclusively being of a very obvious martial nature.   
   
Some of downsides of wearing armour can be countered by acquiring the [trait](/not_created.md) _Armourer_.
