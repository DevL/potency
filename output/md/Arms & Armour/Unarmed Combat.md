Based on the [skill](../Skills/Skills.md) with the same name, this is used when no weapons are used. Also used for grapples and the like. A special effect of training the _unarmed combat_ skill is that the damage of oneâ€™s unarmed attack is improved to 3D, 4D, and 5D for skill levels 3, 4, and 5 respectively.
