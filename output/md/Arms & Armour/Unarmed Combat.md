alias: unarmed combat

Based on the [skill](../Skills/Skills.md) with the same name, this is used when no weapons are used. Also used for grapples and the like. As with [melee weapons](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Melee%20Weapons.md) and [ranged weapons](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Ranged%20Weapons.md), the base damage is determined by the underlying skill, but unless the [trait](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) _Natural Weapons_ has been acquired, no [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) are applied to the physical damage roll.
