## Weapon Damage   
The damage caused by a weapon is rolled against the target’s _resistance_. If the target’s _resistance_ is overcome, it suffer a single [wound](../Conditions/Conditions.md). In case of a [massive success](../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Success.md), the target suffers two wounds.   
   
## Weapon Categories   
There are two broad categories that weapons fall under; [melee weapons](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Melee%20Weapons.md) and [ranged weapons](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Ranged%20Weapons.md). In addition, causing harm without using weapons falls under [unarmed combat](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Unarmed%20Combat.md).    
   
## Damage Type   
A weapon’s damage type indicate the amount of [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) that is added to the physical damage roll.   
   
### Light   
Light weapons add 1B to the physical damage roll. Most are _one-handed_ and in general they tend to be much more inconspicuous than their heavier counterparts.   
   
### Medium   
Medium weapons add 2B to the physical damage roll. Many are _hand-and-a-half_ gripped.   
   
### Heavy   
Heavy weapons add 3B to the physical damage roll. They are almost always _two-handed_ and of a very obvious martial nature.   
   
## Grip   
A weapon’s grip determine whether one or two hands are needed to use the weapon. Wielding a weapon in both hands makes it impossible to also use a [shield](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Shields.md) at the same time.    
   
### One-Handed (1H)   
One-handed weapons require a single hand to be used.   
   
### Two-Handed (2H)   
Two-handed weapons require both hands to be used.   
   
### Hand-and-a-half (1-2H)   
Hand-and-a-half weapons can be used either one-handed or two-handed.   
   
## Additional Weapon Properties   
Some weapons have a number of additional properties further defining them.   
   
### Missile   
Missile weapons are [ranged weapons](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Ranged%20Weapons.md) that are loaded with missiles that are launched.   
   
### Powerful   
Powerful weapons only requires to succeed against the target’s _resistance_ by 5 or more to result in a [massive success](../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Success.md) that causes two [wounds](../Conditions/Wound.md).   
   
### Slow   
Slow weapons can only be used once per [round](../Game%20Modes/Rounds.md). They require time to be readied before the next attack.   
   
### Thrown   
Thrown weapons are [ranged weapons](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Ranged%20Weapons.md) with limited range.   
   
### Weak   
Weak weapons inflicts [fatigue](../Conditions/Fatigue.md) rather than a [wound](../Conditions/Wound.md). A [massive success](../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Success.md) results in a single [wound](../Conditions/Wound.md).
