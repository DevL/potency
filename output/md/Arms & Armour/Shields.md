_Shields_ are either _light_, _medium_, or _heavy_. In general, _light_ shields tends to be much more inconspicuous than their heavier counterparts, with _heavy_ armour almost exclusively being of a very obvious martial nature.   
   
Some of downsides of using shields can be countered by acquiring the [trait](/not_created.md) _Shield Bearer_.
