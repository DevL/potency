aliases: focus, foci

A temporary bonus to a roll in certain situations. Effectively allows the character to [aid](../Rolling%20Dice/Aid.md) themselves in [real time](../Game%20Modes/Real%20Time.md) and gain +1B in [relaxed time](../Game%20Modes/Relaxed%20Time.md). Note that the bonus is only gained for _active rolls_ - the [passive value](../Rolling%20Dice/Passive%20Value.md) is not affected in any way.   
   
If acquiring the same focus a second time, it turns into a [trait](../Character%20Options/Talents.md).
