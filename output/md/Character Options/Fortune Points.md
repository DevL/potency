A fortune point can be spent _before_ any roll to gain a [bonus die](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) or _after_ a roll to re-roll it. The result of the re-roll stands.   
   
Multiple fortune points cannot be spent on the same roll to gain multiple [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md), and only one re-roll is possible.
