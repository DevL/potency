Creating a character involves spending [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) in three or more steps; early life and two or more careers.   
   
```
REWORK: Switching to careers with 5 primary and 5 secondary skills, with Early Life granting 10 automatic raises to skill level 2.
```
   
   
## Early Life   
All [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md) start at [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 1 (_untrained_). You may raise 10 over [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md) one level to [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 2 (_trained_). You may also acquire any free [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) that are available at this point in time, e.g. the trait _Small Stature_.   
   
## First Career   
Select five _primary skills_ and five _secondary skills_ for this career. For each _primary skill_ you roll [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) twice and for each _secondary skill_ you roll a single [skill die](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md). You may also acquire up to 3 [talents](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) or [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) in addition to any free traits you fulfil the requirements for. You may do this in any order so you may raise a required skill and then acquire a trait and vice versa.   
   
## Subsequent Careers   
Once again, select five _primary skills_, five _secondary skills_, and gain a [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) or [trait](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) in addition to any free traits you fulfil the requirements for. You may do this in any order so you may raise a required skill and then acquire a trait and vice versa.
