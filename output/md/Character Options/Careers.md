Creating a character involves raising [skill levels](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) and acquiring [talents](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) and [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) in three or more steps; early life and two or more careers.   
   
## Early Life   
All [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md) start at [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 1 (_untrained_). You may raise 10 over [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md) one level to [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 2 (_trained_).   
   
## Careers   
Select five _primary skills_ and five _secondary skills_ for this career. For each _primary skill_ you roll [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) twice and for each _secondary skill_ you roll a single [skill die](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md). You may also acquire two [talents](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) or [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) you fulfil the requirements for. You may do this in any order so you may raise a required skill and then acquire a trait and vice versa.
