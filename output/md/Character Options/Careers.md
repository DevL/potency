Creating a character involves spending [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) in three or more steps; early life and two or more careers.   
   
## Early Life   
All [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md) start at [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 1 (_untrained_). You may spend 20 [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) to attempt to improve your [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md) one level to [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 2 (_trained_). You may roll up to 2 [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) per skill, but no skill can be advanced beyond [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 2.   
   
You may also acquire any free [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) that are available at this point in time, e.g. the trait _Small Stature_.   
   
## First Career   
You may now spend another 20 [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md), as well as acquire up to 3 [talents](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) or [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) in addition to any free traits you fulfil the requirements for. You may do this in any order so you may raise a required skill and then acquire a trait and vice versa. You may roll up to 2 [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) per skill, but no skill can be advanced beyond [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 3 (_competent_).   
   
## Second Career   
You may spend another 20 [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md), as well as acquire another [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) or [trait](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) in addition to any free traits you fulfil the requirements for. You may do this in any order so you may raise a required skill and then acquire a trait and vice versa. You may roll up to 2 [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) per skill, but no skill can be advanced beyond [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 4 (_skilled_).   
   
## Additional Careers   
For each additional career, you receive a free [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) or [trait](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) of your choice and may spend 20 [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) to improve your skills.  You may roll up to 2 [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) per skill and can advance a skill to any [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md), including 5 (_master_).   
   
## Forgoing Rolling   
If you forgo rolling [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) entirely during character creation, you may instead spend 25 skill dice per career and you may save up to 5 skill dice between careers.
