Creating a character involves spending [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) in three or more steps; early life and two or more careers.   
   
## Early Life   
Start by raising all [mundane skill](../Skills/Skills.md) to [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 2 (_trained_). You _may_ reduce up to 5 of the skills from 2 to 1 (_untrained_), but be aware that in doing so, you will likely not be able to ever attempt an [active roll](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md) for those skills unless they are improved. You may save up to 10 [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) to the next step.   
   
> You should now have spent 40-50 [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md), have no [magical skills](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md), and have no [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md) at a [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) over 2 (_trained_).   
   
## First Career   
You may now use any saved [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) from the previous step and up to an additional 25 points to increase [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md) to [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 3 (_competent_) and acquire [talents](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) and [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md). You also receive a free [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) or [trait](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) of your choice. If you have taken the [trait](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) _Arcane Initiate_ you may also raise [magical skills](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md) up to [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 2 (_trained_).   
   
You may save up to 10 [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) before continuing to the second career.   
   
> You should now have spent 65-75 [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md), have no [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md) at a [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) over 3 (_competent_), and have no [magical skills](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md) at a [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) over 2 (_trained_) unless you have taken the [trait](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) _Innate Magic_.   
   
## Additional Careers   
For each career, you receive a free [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) or [trait](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) of your choice and may spend 25 [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) plus any points saved from a previous step. As during the _early life_ you may spend your points to increase [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md), increase and acquire [magical skills](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md), and acquire additional [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md). However, you may not increase a skill more than one [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) per career. Lastly, you may save up to 10 [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) if you have additional careers to complete.   
   
> After completing a second career, you should have spent 90-100 [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md), have at most [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 4 (_skilled_) in [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md), and at most [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 3 (_competent_) in [magical skills](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md). After completing three careers, you may have [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md) reach [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 5 (_master_) and [magical skills](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md) reach [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 4 (_skilled)_. After four careers it is possible to have reached [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 5 (_master_) also in [magical skills](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md).
