A skill dice can be used to improve the [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) of [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md) or [spells](../Magic/Spells%20and%20Magical%20Effects.md). When expending a skill die, select a [skill](../Skills/Skills.md) and roll the skill die. If the roll is higher than the next [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md), the skill is raised to that level. If a 6 is rolled, roll the die again. If the second roll is equal to or lower than the current [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md), gain a [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) for the [skill](../Skills/Skills.md) and then increase the skill one level as with a normal success. It is possible to spend a skill dice in the hope of gaining a [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) for a [skill](../Skills/Skills.md) that already is at [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 5.   
   
Note that no [wild die](../Rolling%20Dice/Wild%20Die.md) is used for this roll.   
   
When [Improving a Character](../Character%20Options/Improving%20a%20Character.md) past [character creation](../Character%20Options/Creating%20a%20Character.md), as an alternative to rolling, it is possible to automatically increase a [skill](../Skills/Skills.md) one level by paying as many skill dice as the new [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md). Since no roll is made, it is not possible to develop a [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) using this option.
