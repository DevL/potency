It all begins with coming up with a character concept. However, it is often very helpful to ask _how_ a character became they way they are, and as such, _Potency_ uses the concept of [careers](../Character%20Options/Careers.md) to guide the character creation.   
   
## Determine Starting Capabilities   
Depending on the level of play, consult the table below for the amount of [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md), [careers](../Character%20Options/Careers.md), the equivalent [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md), and the number of free [talents](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) or [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) granted.   
   
| Level of Play | Potential | Careers | Skill Dice | Talents or Traits |   
|:------------- |:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|:-----------------:|   
| Beginner      |    10     |    2    |     30     |         4         |   
| Adventurer    |    12     |    3    |     45     |         6         |   
| Veteran       |    15     |    5    |     75     |        10         |   
| Heroic        |    20     |    8    |    120     |        16         |   
   
```
TBD: Rebalance the starting capabilities with regards to careers, potential etc
```
   
   
## Determine Skill Levels, Talents & Traits   
In accordance with what is allowed by your [careers](../Character%20Options/Careers.md), use your [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) to increase [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md), increase [magical skills](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md), and obtain possibly develop [talents](../Character%20Options/Talents.md). You may also acquire various [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) as long as you fulfil the prerequisites for a given trait.   
   
## Select Arms & Armour   
Unless otherwise stated by the game master, there are no general limitations on what equipment a character can have when they begin their adventures. Make sure to have a conversation with your game master though - especially if you wish to have something magical or very expensive.
