It all begins with coming up with a character concept. However, it is often very helpful to ask _how_ a character became they way they are, and as such, _Potency_ uses the concept of [careers](../Character%20Options/Careers.md) to guide the character creation.   
   
## Determine Starting Capabilities   
Depending on the level of play, consult the table below for the amount of [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md), [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md), number of [careers](../Character%20Options/Careers.md), relevant [skill](../Skills/Skills.md) caps, and the number of free [talents](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) or [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) granted.   
   
| Level of Play | Potential | Character Points | Careers | Mundane Skill Cap | Magical Skill Cap | Free Talents or Traits |   
|:------------- | ---------:| ----------------:| -------:| -----------------:| -----------------:| ----------------------:|   
| Beginner      |        10 |              100 |       2 |                 4 |                 3 |                      2 |   
| Adventurer    |        12 |              125 |       3 |                 5 |                 4 |                      3 |   
| Veteran       |        15 |              175 |       5 |                 5 |                 5 |                      5 |   
| Heroic        |        20 |              225 |       7 |                 5 |                 5 |                      7 |   
   
## Spending Character Points   
In accordance with what is allowed by your [careers](../Character%20Options/Careers.md), use your [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) to increase [mundane skills](../Skills/Skills.md), increase [magical skills](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md), and obtain [talents](../Character%20Options/Talents.md). You may also acquire various [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) as long as you fulfil the prerequisites for a given trait.   
   
## Select arms & armour   
Unless otherwise stated by the gamemaster, there are no general limitations on what equipment a character can have when they begin their adventures. Make sure to have a conversation with your gamemaster though - especially if you wish to have something magical or very expensive.
