Shorter and less powerful built than [dwarves](../../Character%20Options/Sapient%20Species/Dwarves.md), _halflings_ are commonly found equally integrated into human societies as well as in their own rural communities. It is believed that they originate from an ancient strain of humans, or a shared ancestor, that were isolated on scarce islands for aeons.
