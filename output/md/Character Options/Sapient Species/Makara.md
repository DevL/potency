This is the explanation for almost any non-human humanoids in that a _makaras_ is a magical meld of species. Ancient lines of _makaras_ have led to several distinct species that are quite common sights in the world.   
   
## Lesser Makaras   
Apart from the more well-known species of _makara_, there are a plethora of rarer _makaras_. An example of this are the very rare pale blue-hued _marfolk_ that on occasion are met along the Jotorian bay. Always living next to the sea, they are extremely loathe to venture far from it. Next to nothing is known about their origin.
