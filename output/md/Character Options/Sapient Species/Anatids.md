_Anatids_ is the collective name for [makaras](../../Character%20Options/Sapient%20Species/Makara.md) fusing elements of avians and humans into a wingless humanoid. Despite the name suggesting the birdlike features stemming from _anatidae_ - water birds such as ducks, geese, or swans - the anatids come in many different forms. Some are tall with hawk-like facial features whereas others are short, stout, and somewhat mallard-like. Alternate names such as _avians_ or _avianfolk_ are commonly accepted and used, though referring to the members of the species as _fowlings_ is generally considered a slur.
