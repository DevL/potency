alias: smallfolk, halfling, halflings
---
   
A common name for human-like creatures of around a meter's height. The most common example of smallfolk refer to themselves as _halflings_. Shorter and less powerful built than [dwarves](../../Character%20Options/Sapient%20Species/Dwarves.md), many _smallfolk_ are commonly found equally integrated into human societies as well as in their own rural communities. It is believed that they originate from an ancient strain of humans, or a shared ancestor, that was isolated on scarce islands for aeons.
