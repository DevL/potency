Past [character creation](../Character%20Options/Creating%20a%20Character.md) and at the game master's discretion, a player character can improve their existing [skills](../Skills/Skills.md) as well as acquire additional [skills](../Skills/Skills.md), [talents](../Character%20Options/Talents.md), and [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md). Usually, the game master will award a number of [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) and possibly allow a [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) or [trait](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) to be gained after the conclusion of an adventure.   
   
## Improving an Existing Skill   
Existing [skills](../Skills/Skills.md) can be improved by rolling [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md). Just as when [creating a character](../Character%20Options/Creating%20a%20Character.md) through [careers](../Character%20Options/Careers.md), no more than two [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) may be rolled per [skill](../Skills/Skills.md). Gaining a [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) by rolling [skill dice](../Character%20Options/Skill%20Dice.md) work in the usual way. As an alternative to rolling, it is possible to automatically increase a [skill](../Skills/Skills.md) one level by paying as many skill dice as the new [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md). Since no roll is made, it is not possible to develop a [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) using this option.   
   
## Learning a New Skill   
Unlike [mundane skills](../Skills/Mundane%20Skills.md), there are additional [extraordinary skills](../Skills/Extraordinary%20Skills.md) that are not immediately available to all characters. These skills are chiefly [spells](../Magic/Spells%20and%20Magical%20Effects.md) or the equivalent. Learning such a skill is considered acquiring a trait and hence is treated as such. When learning a new skill in this manner, it starts at [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 1 (_untrained_).   
   
## Developing a Talent   
Just like when [creating a character](../Character%20Options/Creating%20a%20Character.md), it is possible to develop a [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) for a known [skill](../Skills/Skills.md).   
   
## Exhibiting a Trait   
Just like when [creating a character](../Character%20Options/Creating%20a%20Character.md), it is possible to exhibit a [trait](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) as long as its prerequisites are fulfilled.
