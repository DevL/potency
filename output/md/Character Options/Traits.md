A trait is a special ability or quirk that sets a character apart from most others.     
   
Unless otherwise noted, acquiring a trait cost 7  [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) unless the trait is picked as the free [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) or trait granted by a career. However, all traits are not only beneficial as some come with drawbacks and such traits are typically free.   
   
Some traits also have certain prerequisites that needs to be fulfilled before acquiring the trait.   
   
   
   
   
## ~~Arcane Initiate~~   
You gain [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 1 (_untrained_) in the seven [magical aspects](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md); _Agency_, _Cognition_, _Essence_, _Formation_, _Manifestation_, _Portation_, and _Sunderance_. This unlocks the possibility to further train the various [magical skills](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md) as any other [skill](../Skills/Skills.md). You also gain the ability to cast very simple spells requiring no more than 3 [spell dice](../Magic/Components/Spell%20Dice.md) without making an [active](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md) spell roll, though potential still needs to be spent.   
   
> Lilly effortlessly ignited the air around the top of her staff, turning into a magical torch.   
   
## Armourer   
_Requires exertion 3 or crafting 4._   
You are used to wearing and adjusting armour to fit your needs. When wearing armour, apply the negative conditions from armour that is one grade lighter than the one you are wearing. Wearing light armour imposes no negative conditions.   
   
> A heavily armoured dwarf is a neither swift, nor quiet affair. And yet, Draggomir moved with an uncanny speed and silence that someone in heavy dwarven mail should not be capable of.    
   
## Aspect of Agency   
You have begun to learn the secrets of the [magical aspect](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md) of *Agency*. You can create and learn spells that require this aspect at a cost of 1 [character point](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) to gain [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 1 (untrained) in it. Furthermore, you can increase the spell's [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) just like any other [skill](../Skills/Skills.md).   
   
## Aspect of Cognition   
You have begun to learn the secrets of the [magical aspect](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md) of *Cognition*. You can create and learn spells that require this aspect at a cost of 1 [character point](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) to gain [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 1 (untrained) in it. Furthermore, you can increase the spell's [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) just like any other [skill](../Skills/Skills.md).   
   
## Aspect of Essence   
You have begun to learn the secrets of the [magical aspect](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md) of *Essence*. You can create and learn spells that require this aspect at a cost of 1 [character point](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) to gain [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 1 (untrained) in it. Furthermore, you can increase the spell's [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) just like any other [skill](../Skills/Skills.md).   
   
   
## Backstabber (TBD)   
_Requires melee combat 3 and stealth 3._   
   
_Some mechanic rewarding additional damage for light weapons when attacking from behind/undetected goes here._   
   
```
TBD
```
   
   
## Berserker   
_Requires exertion 3 and resistance 3._   
Frenzied and at the expense of your own safety, you relentlessly attack your foes.   
By forgoing any [active](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md) _defence_ rolls this round, you may make an additional _melee combat_ or _unarmed combat_ attack without expending any [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md). In addition, if you are using a [shield](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Shields.md), you instead count it as a [light melee weapon](../Arms%20%26%20Armour/Melee%20Weapons.md) as you use it to bash your opponents rather than protect yourself.   
   
> The berendakian warrior went berserk, swinging all around her with her battle axe and round shield. Normally they would count as a one-handed medium weapon and a medium shield, but now they were used to dual wield a medium and a light weapon.   
   
## Careful Caster   
_Requires any magical skill 3._   
When using magic, you have learnt to be wary of and avoid magical backlash. If a [massive failure](../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Failure.md) to cast a spell would cause you [fatigue](../Conditions/Fatigue.md), you ignore it. If a [massive failure](../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Failure.md) instead would cause you a [wound](../Conditions/Wound.md), you instead sustain [fatigue](../Conditions/Fatigue.md).    
   
> Alexander felt how his spell faltered and instantly braced against the ensuing backlash. Through many harsh lessons, he had learnt to dodge much of the misfiring potential.   
   
## Deadly Accuracy   
_Requires perception 3 and ranged combat 3._   
With pinpoint accuracy, your missiles always seem to hit where it hurts the most.   
You increase your physical damage caused by ranged weapons with 1B. If your physical damage already has 3B, your target instead adds 1M to their _resistance_ roll against the damage.    
   
> Noomeron raised her bow, breathed out and hit the beast right between the eyes.   
   
## Fast Reactions   
_Requires movement 3._   
You gain 1B for any [initiative](../Game%20Modes/Rolling%20Initiative.md) rolls you make and when entering into [real time](../Game%20Modes/Real%20Time.md), you expend no [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md). You expend [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) as normal when [seizing the initiative](../Game%20Modes/Rolling%20Initiative.md), though you gain the [bonus die](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md).   
   
> Alexander drew his wavy black blade and struck before anyone else had time to react.   
   
## Fortunate   
You are luckier than most. Whenever you would normally gain a [fortune point](../Rolling%20Dice/Fortune%20Points.md) through non-magical means, you instead gain two points   
   
## Heavy Hitter   
_Requires exertion 3 and melee combat 3._   
Your strength makes your blows strike harder than most.    
You increase your physical damage caused by melee weapons with 1B. If your physical damage already has 3B, your target instead adds 1M to their _resistance_ roll against the damage.   
   
> Ever seen an enraged ogre swinging a tree trunk in your direction. Yes? Liar! You would be dead if you had!   
   
## Innate Magic   
You know not of the magical arts and aspects. You know not how to wield magic. You just do it.   
   
You gain the unique [magical skill](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md) _Innate Magic_ at [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 3. You cannot train this skill further.   
   
Create a spell that uses no more than a single [magical aspect](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md), no more than 9 [spell dice](../Magic/Components/Spell%20Dice.md), and does not require a [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) higher than 3. You do not need to know the aspect involved and can cast this spell using _Innate Magic_.   
   
```
TBD: allow multiple spells as long as they combined donâ€™t exceed 10 spell dice?
```
   
   
> Not everyone is this world learns magic by studying it. Some are born with it, though they might only master a fraction of the arts. Ever noticed how the village healer seems to be able to just lay her hands on a wound and concentrate to close it? If that is not some form of innate magic at work, I don't know what it is!   
   
## Iron Will   
_Requires willpower 3._   
As a reaction, when sustaining [fatigue](../Conditions/Fatigue.md) or [wounds](../Conditions/Wound.md) during a [real time](../Game%20Modes/Real%20Time.md) event, it is possible to temporarily ignore their adverse effects by making a _willpower_ roll against a difficulty of 5 times the combined severity of the sustained conditions, though at least 10.    
   
Once the [real time](../Game%20Modes/Real%20Time.md) event transitions into another [mode of play](../Game%20Modes/Modes%20of%20Play.md), the effects of the conditions can no longer be ignored.   
   
At no point does this trait counteract the effect of being knocked out by too many cumulative [conditions](../Conditions/Conditions.md).   
   
> Draggomir, having already sustained two levels of _fatigue_, gets hit by a giant and would usually be grievously wounded, suffering two _wounds_. However, he miraculously makes his _willpower_ roll, granted by his _iron will_, by rolling 22 against the necessary 20. He can thus ignore the detrimental effects of all conditions wound, but it still counts against the amount of conditions needed to be lost before being knocked out.   
   
## Muse   
_Requires artistry 3._   
Your artistic talents inspire those around you to great feats. You can use your skill in _artistry_ to [aid](../Rolling%20Dice/Aid.md) someone in their task by making an _artistry_ roll instead of the skill normally used for the task, using the same difficulty.   
   
> Alexander the bard recites a naughty limerick, invigorating - somewhat against her will - Lilly to pull the ancient lever with enough strength to close the portcullis before the undead horde reaches the party. He rolls a 12 against the difficulty of 10 and thus Lilly gets a bonus die to her _exertion_ roll when she tries to pull the lever with all her might. Had Alexander come up with an even better poem by, say rolling a 15, Lilly would have gained two bonus dice.    
   
## Natural Weapons   
_Requires exertion 3 and unarmed combat 3._   
Through claws or fists, you are deadly even unarmed.   
You increase your physical damage caused by unarmed strikes with 1B. If your physical damage already has 3B, your target instead adds 1M to their _resistance_ roll against the damage.   
   
> Aun the minotaur was a peaceful man, always eager to use his extensive skills of healing. However, when he had no choice but to resort to violence, his innate strength subsequently made his skills of healing all the more needed.   
   
## Potent Caster   
_Requires any magical skill 3._   
You have mastered the flow of potential to the point that you can cause even greater effects when casting spells. After casting a spell, but before resolving its effects, you may spend [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) equal to the [spell volume](../Magic/Components/Volume.md) to add a [bonus die](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) to the [spell effect](../Magic/Components/Effect.md).   
   
> Draggomir invokes the magic of the rune etched into his upper arm, intent on boosting his might using formation of agency. He would normally cast the spell using a spell volume of 1 and thus he only needs to spend an additional potential to gain a bonus die for the spell effect.   
   
> Lilly sends her swarm of scorching fire towards a group of enemies. The group is large enough to require a spell volume of 3 so she needs to spend 3 additional potential to increase the effect by a bonus die.   
   
## Shield Bearer   
_Requires exertion 3 or crafting 4._   
You are used to wearing and adjusting shields to fit your needs. When using a shield, apply the negative conditions from shields that is one grade lighter than the one you are using. Using light shields impose no negative conditions.   
   
> Laurelle af Marg is a superb warrior, highly skilled in using a shield without it encumbering her. When raising her heater shield emblazoned with the arms of the barony of Brechten, it is as if she was using a small targe. No more does it hinder her.   
   
## Small Stature   
_Free trait. Can only be taken during the first step of character creation._   
You are smaller than most and as such you lack the physicality to wield heavy weapons or shields. On the upside, you are generally harder to hit and therefore receive a [talent](../Character%20Options/Talents.md) in the _defence_ skill for free.   
   
> Being a part of the smallfolk, Hilda of Kullsala has always had to limit the arms she bore as a member of the town watch. On the other hand, she was rarely hit when breaking up fights in the sleepy town.    
   
## Sustainable Spells   
_Requires any magical skill 3._   
When [sustaining](../Magic/Components/Sustain.md) a spell, you expend less [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) than other casters.    
Calculate [sustain](../Magic/Components/Sustain.md) as 1/2 of the [spell dice](../Magic/Components/Spell%20Dice.md), rounded.   
   
> Lilly is sustaining a spell that was cast using 6 spell dice. Normally it would take 4P to sustain it during subsequent rounds, but her Sustainable Spells trait reduces it to 3P.   
   
## Wild Magic   
_Free trait. Requires any magical skill 1._   
Magic is an innate power to you, but it is hard to control. When you cast a spell, you gain 1B to the effect roll, but do so at the cost of 1M for the magical skill roll. Also, a [massive failure](../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Failure.md) to cast a spell will cause you [wound](../Conditions/Wound.md) rather than [fatigue](../Conditions/Fatigue.md).   
   
If you cast a spell at [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 4 or more, you may chose not to apply the effects of wild magic when casting the spell.   
   
> Lilly grew up setting things ablaze a bit too often. With time she has mostly mastered the art of magic without causing too much collateral damage.
