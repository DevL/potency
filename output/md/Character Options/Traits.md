A trait is a special ability or quirk that sets a character apart from most others. All traits are not only beneficial as some come with drawbacks. The cost in [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) to acquire a trait is in noted in parenthesis. Some traits also have certain prerequisites that needs to be fulfilled before acquiring the trait.   
   
## Arcane Initiate (10)   
You gain [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 1 (_untrained_) in the seven [magical aspects](../Skills/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md); _Agency_, _Cognition_, _Essence_, _Formation_, _Manifestation_, _Portation_, and _Sunderance_. This unlocks the possibility to further train the various [magical skills](../Skills/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md) as any other [skill](../Skills/Skills.md). You also gain the ability to cast very simple spells requiring no more than 3 [spell dice](../Magic/Components/Spell%20Dice.md) without making an [active](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md) spell roll.   
   
## Armourer (8)   
_Requires exertion 3 or crafting 4._   
You are used to wearing and adjusting armour to fit your needs. When wearing armour, apply the negative conditions from armour that is one grade lighter than the one you are wearing. Wearing light armour imposes no negative conditions.   
   
> A heavily armoured dwarf is a neither swift, nor quiet affair. And yet, Draggomir moved with an uncanny speed and silence that someone in heavy dwarven mail should not be capable of.    
   
## Careful Caster (6)   
_Requires any magical skill 3._   
When using magic, you have learnt to be wary of and avoid magical backlash. When failing to cast a spell, you reduce the [fatigue](../Conditions/Fatigue.md) you sustain by one degree.

> Alexander felt how his spell faltered and instantly braced against the ensuing backlash. Through many harsh lessons, he had learnt to dodge at least some of the misfiring potential.   
   
## Deadly Accuracy (10)   
_Requires perception 3 and ranged combat 3._   
With pinpoint accuracy, your missiles always seem to hit where it hurts the most.   
You increase your physical damage caused by ranged weapons with 1B.   
   
> Noomeron raised her bow, breathed out and hit the beast right between the eyes.   
   
## Dual Wielder (5)   
_Requires melee combat 3._   
You are trained in the art of using two weapons to the extent that you no longer are limited to using at most a medium weapon in your main hand and only a light weapon in your off-hand.   
   
> Elsa drew her two arming swords, seemingly from thin air. Her assailants would soon find out that though the blades were made of ice, they cut just as unforgivingly as the finest steel.   
   
## Fast Reactions (5)   
_Requires movement 3._   
When [rolling initiative](../Game%20Modes/Rolling%20Initiative.md) you gain 1B. This also applies when [seizing the initiative](../Game%20Modes/Rolling%20Initiative.md).    
   
> Alexander drew his wavy black blade and struck before anyone else had time to react.   
   
## Fortunate (TBD)   
You are luckier than most. _Some mechanic rewarding additional Fortune Points goes here._   
   
```

```
   
   
## Heavy Hitter (10)   
_Requires exertion 3 and melee combat 3._   
Your strength makes your blows strike harder than most.    
You increase your physical damage caused by melee weapons with 1B.   
   
> Ever seen an enraged ogre swinging a tree trunk in your direction. Yes? Liar! You would be dead if you had!   
   
## Innate Magic (10)   
You know not of the magical arts and aspects. You know not how to wield magic. You just do it.   
You gain the unique [magical skill](../Skills/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md) _Innate Magic_ at [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 3. You cannot train this skill further.   
   
Create a spell that uses no more than 3 [magical aspects](../Skills/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md), no more than 9 [spell dice](../Magic/Components/Spell%20Dice.md), and does not require a [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) higher than 3. You do not need to know the aspects involved and can cast this spell using _Innate Magic_.   
   
> Not everyone is this world learns magic by studying it. Some are born with it, though they might only master a fraction of the arts. Ever noticed how the village healer seems to be able to just lay her hands on a wound and concentrate to close it? If that is not some form of innate magic at work, I don't know what it is!   
   
## Iron Will (5)   
_Requires willpower 3._   
When sustaining a [condition](../Conditions/Conditions.md) during a [real time](../Game%20Modes/Real%20Time.md) event, it is possible to temporarily ignore its adverse effects by making a _willpower_ roll against a difficulty of 5 + 5 times the severity of the condition. Once the [real time](../Game%20Modes/Real%20Time.md) event transitions into another [mode of play](../Game%20Modes/Modes%20of%20Play.md), the effects of the condition can no longer be ignored. At no point does this trait counteract the effect of being knocked out by cumulative [conditions](../Conditions/Conditions.md) normally reducing [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) to 0.

> Draggomir gets hit by a giant and would usually be grievously wounded, suffering a _wounded (3)_ condition. However, he miraculously makes his _willpower_ roll, granted by his _iron will_, by rolling 22 against the necessary 20. He can thus ignore the detrimental effects of this wound, but it still counts against the amount of potential needed to be lost before being knocked out.    
   
## Muse (5)   
_Requires artistry 3._   
Your artistic talents inspire those around you to great feats. You can use your skill in _artistry_ to [aid](../Rolling%20Dice/Aid.md) someone in their task by making in _artistry_ roll. The gamemaster will determine the difficulty. Additional [degrees of success](/not_created.md) yield extra [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md).

> Alexander the bard recites a naughty limerick, invigorating - somewhat against her will - Lilly to pull the ancient lever with enough strength to close the portcullis before the undead horde reaches the party. He rolls a 12 against the difficulty of 10 and thus Lilly gets a bonus die to her _exertion_ roll when she tries to pull the lever with all her might. Had Alexander come up with an even better poem by, say rolling a 15, Lilly would have gained two bonus dice.    
   
## Natural Weapons (10)   
_Requires exertion 3 and unarmed combat 3._   
Through claws or fists, you are deadly even unarmed.   
You increase your physical damage caused by unarmed strikes with 1B.   
   
> Aun the minotaur was a peaceful man, always eager to use his extensive skills of healing. However, when he had no choice but to resort to violence, his innate strength subsequently made his skills of healing all the more needed.   
   
## Shield Bearer (8)   
_Requires exertion 3 or crafting 4._   
You are used to wearing and adjusting shields to fit your needs. When using a shield, apply the negative conditions from shields that is one grade lighter than the one you are using. Using light shields impose no negative conditions.   
   
> Laurelle af Marg is a superb warrior, highly skilled in using a shield without it encumbering her. When raising her medium shield blazoned with the arms of the barony of Brechten, it is as if she was using a small targe. No more does it hinder her.   
   
## Small Stature (0)   
_Can only be taken during the first step of character creation._   
You are smaller than most and as such you lack the physicality to wield heavy weapons or shields. On the upside, you are generally harder to hit and therefore receive a [focus](../Character%20Options/Foci.md) in the _defence_ skill for free.   
   
> Being a part of the smallfolk, Hilda of Kullsala has always had to limit the arms she bore as a member of the town watch. On the other hand, she was rarely hit when breaking up fights in the sleepy town.    
   
## Wild Magic (5)   
_Requires any magical skill 2._   
Magic is an innate power to you, but it is hard to control. When you cast a spell, you gain 1B to the effect roll, but do so at the cost of 1M for the magical skill roll. If you cast a spell at [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) 4 or more, you may chose not to apply the effects of wild magic when casting the spell.   
   
> Lilly grew up setting things ablaze a bit too often. With time she has mostly mastered the art of magic without causing too much collateral damage.
