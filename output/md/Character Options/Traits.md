A trait is a special ability or quirk that sets a character apart from most others. All traits are not only beneficial as some come with drawbacks. The cost in [character points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) to acquire a trait is in noted in parenthesis. Some traits also have certain prerequisites that needs to be fulfilled before acquiring the trait.   
   
## Armourer (5)   
_Requires exertion 3 or crafting 4._   
You are used to wearing and adjusting armour to fit your needs. When wearing armour, apply the negative conditions from armour that is one grade lighter than the one you are wearing. Wearing light armour imposes no negative conditions.   
   
> A heavily armoured dwarf is a neither swift, nor quiet affair. And yet, Draggomir moved with an uncanny speed and silence that someone in heavy dwarven mail should not be capable of.    
   
## Dual Wielder (5)   
_Requires melee combat 3._   
You are trained in the art of using two weapons to the extent that you no longer are limited to using at most a medium weapon in your main hand and only a light weapon in your off-hand.   
   
> Elsa drew her two arming swords, seemingly from thin air. Her assailants would soon find out that though the blades were made of ice, they cut just as unforgivingly as the finest steel.   
   
## Heavy Hitter (5)   
_Requires exertion 3._   
Your strength makes your blows strike harder than most. You may spend 2P to increase your physical damage caused by melee weapons and unarmed strikes with 1B.   
   
> Aun the minotaur was a peaceful man, always eager to use his extensive skills of healing. However, when he had no choice but to resort to violence, his inate strength subsequently made his skills of healing all the more needed.   
   
## Iron Will (5)   
_Requires willpower 3._   
When sustaining a [condition](../Conditions/Conditions.md) during a [real time](../Game%20Modes/Real%20Time.md) event, it is possible to temporarily ignore its adverse effects by making a _willpower_ roll against a difficulty of 5 + 5 times the severity of the condition. Once the [real time](../Game%20Modes/Real%20Time.md) event transitions into another [mode of play](../Game%20Modes/Modes%20of%20Play.md), the effects of the condition can no longer be ignored. At no point does this trait counteract the effect of being knocked out by cumulative [conditions](../Conditions/Conditions.md) normally reducing [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) to 0.   
   
> Draggomir gets hit by a giant and would usally be grievously wounded, suffering a _wounded (3)_ condition. However, he miracuously makes his _willpower_ roll, granted by his _iron will_, by rolling 22 against the necessary 20. He can thus ignore the detrimental effects of this wound, but it still counts against the amount of potential needed to be lost before being knocked out.    
   
## Muse (5)   
_Requires artistry 3._   
Your artistic talents inspire those around you to great feats. You can use your skill in _artistry_ to [aid](../Rolling%20Dice/Aid.md) someone in their task by making in _artistry_ roll. The gamemaster will determine the difficulty. Additional [degrees of success](/not_created.md) yield extra [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md).   
   
> Alexander the bard recites a naughty limerick, invigorating - somewhat against her will - Lilly to pull the ancient lever with enough strength to close the portculis before the undead horde reaches the party. He rolls a 12 against the difficulty of 10 and thus Lilly gets a bonus die to her _exertion_ roll when she tries to pull the lever with all her might. Had Alexander come up with an even better poem by, say rolling a 15, Lilly would have gained two bonus dice.    
   
## Shield Bearer (5)   
_Requires exertion 3 or crafting 4._   
You are used to wearing and adjusting shields to fit your needs. When using a shield, apply the negative conditions from shields that is one grade lighter than the one you are using. Using light shields imposes no negative conditions.   
   
> Laurelle af Marg is a supurb warrior, highly skilled in using a shield without it encumbering her. When raising her medium shield blazoned with the arms of the barony of Brechten, it is as if she was using a small targe. No more does it hinder her.   
   
## Small Stature (0)   
_Can only be taken during the first step of character creation._   
You are smaller than most and as such you lack the physicality to wield heavy weapons or shields. On the upside, you are generally harder to hit and therefore receive a [focus](../Character%20Options/Foci.md) in the _defence_ skill for free.   
   
> Being a part of the smallfolk, Hilda of Kullsala has always had to limit the arms she bore as a member of the townswatch. On the other hand, she was rarely hit when breaking up fights in the sleepy town.
