When the exact order and sequence of events become important, it is time to enter _real time_. This mode makes use of both [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) and requires all actors involved to [roll initiative](../Game%20Modes/Rolling%20Initiative.md). Tracking the sequence of events is done using [rounds](../Game%20Modes/Rounds.md) and [turns](../Game%20Modes/Turns.md).
