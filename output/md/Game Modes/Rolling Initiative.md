aliases: roll initiative, rolling initiative

When entering into [real time](../Game%20Modes/Real%20Time.md), the actors involved all roll initative. In addition to the [wild die](../Rolling%20Dice/Wild%20Die.md), each actor can add as much [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) to the roll as their [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) in _movement_. The potential added will be taken from the actor’s potential for the the first round.   
   
> Amgus has 10P and 2 levels in _movement_. When rolling initative, he may spend 0-2 potential from his first round’s initative and add it to the roll.   
   
## Seizing the Initative   
   
As an action, an actor may roll for initative as normal and use the new result as the initative for the upcoming rounds.   
   
> Amgus has rolled an initative of 4, putting him last in the initative order. When it becomes his turn, he spends 2P to make a new initative roll. This time he rolls 13, advancing him a few places in the turn order for the next round and beyond.
