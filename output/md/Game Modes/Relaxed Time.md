In this mode, [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) is not really a factor. It is assumed that an actor has as much potential available to perform any action as well as they possibly can. The exception is when an actor has sustained so many [conditions](../Conditions/Conditions.md) that their [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) has been lowered so much that they would not be able to perform a given action in [real time](../Game%20Modes/Real%20Time.md) or [tense time](../Game%20Modes/Tense%20Time.md) at their maximum capability.   
   
In order to [recover](../Conditions/Recovery.md) from [conditions](../Conditions/Conditions.md) such as [fatigue](../Conditions/Fatigue.md) and [wounds](../Conditions/Wound.md), the game needs to stay in _relaxed time_.   
   
> Amgus has through his trials and tribulations sustained so many wounds and so much fatigue that his potential has been reduced to a mere 3P. Even in relaxed time, he cannot attempt any action requiring more than 3P.
