Between [relaxed time](../Game%20Modes/Relaxed%20Time.md) and [real time](../Game%20Modes/Real%20Time.md), resides this mode of play. Like [relaxed time](../Game%20Modes/Relaxed%20Time.md), the concept of using [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) to determine how much and how well an actor can do things is used, but no [initiative order](../Game%20Modes/Rolling%20Initiative.md) is used. In addition, the players can share potential through a [shared potential pool](../Game%20Modes/Shared%20Potential%20Pool.md).   
   
> This mode is well-suited for when there is a limit to how much the players can do before something _might_ happen that would trigger [real time](../Game%20Modes/Real%20Time.md). Like the name alludes, it comes in handy when the game master wants to signal a transition from the calm and safe to the tense and thrilling.
