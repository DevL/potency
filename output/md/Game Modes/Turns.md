During a [round](../Game%20Modes/Rounds.md), each [actor](../Rolling%20Dice/Actors.md) gets a _turn_ according to their [initiative order](../Game%20Modes/Rolling%20Initiative.md). During their _turn_, an actor can perform [actions](../Rolling%20Dice/Actions%20and%20Reactions.md) whereas other actors only can [react](../Rolling%20Dice/Actions%20and%20Reactions.md).
