aliases: shared potential, shared potential pool
---
   
During [tense time](../Game%20Modes/Tense%20Time.md), the playersâ€™ actors have access to a shared pool of [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) which they can use to withdraw and deposit potential as needed.    
   
## Depositing Potential   
As an action, a player actor can deposit any amount of available [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) to the pool.   
   
> Amgus has performed the actions that he wants to do this round and has some potential to spare. He deposits them to the shared potential pool.   
   
## Withdrawing Potential   
When an actor no longer has enough [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) to perform a desired action, as much potential as needed can be withdrawn from the pool.   
   
> Lilly has too little potential left to cast a spell. She withdraws the 3P that is needed from the shared potential pool.
