_Potency_ is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game set in a world where gods and demons, the arcane and the divine, the magical and the mundane essentially all are the same. Within all things containing the spark of _agency_ resides _potential_. Within all beings, living and otherwise, through _cognition_ reality can changed. Moving a rock by hand or by will is merely two different ways of something with _cognition_ using its _potential_ through its _agency_ to alter the _essence_ of the rock.   
   
In this world, most are unaware of this fundamental truth and thus the belief in gods and in magic are widely spread. A few have an intuitive sense of parts of this truth. Fewer still understand it fully.   
   
## The System   
   
* D6-based, skill-based, roll-over resolution.   
* Flexible action economy where the resource _potential_ governs how much can be done and how well.   
* Combat is dangerous and sustaining damage lowers oneâ€™s potential until healed.   
* Magic is flexible, but far from required to play a powerful character.
