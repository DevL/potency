Mundane skills are grouped into five subcategories: [Combat Skills](../Skills/Mundane%20Skills/Combat%20Skills.md), [Intellectual Skills](../Skills/Mundane%20Skills/Intellectual%20Skills.md), [Physical Skills](../Skills/Mundane%20Skills/Physical%20Skills.md), [Practical Skills](../Skills/Mundane%20Skills/Practical%20Skills.md), and [Social Skills](../Skills/Mundane%20Skills/Social%20Skills.md).    
   
All player character’s start with a [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) of 1 (_untrained_) in mundane skills whereas other skills need be acquired, e.g. as part of a [trait](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) or through gameplay at the game master’s behest.
