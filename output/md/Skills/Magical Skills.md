Magical skills differ from [mundane skills](/not_created.md) in that a character does not automatically have them, not even at the lowest, untrained level of 1. To acquire a magical skill, the player needs to have a conversation with the game master regarding the theme, possibilities, and limitations it entails. A broad magical skill that can be used for many kinds of spells should cost more character points than a narrower, more focused and limited skill.   
   
## The Nature of Magic   
   
>  _Casting a spell is essentially the act of transforming potential into a change of reality. To some, it is reaching out with your mind and strength of will instead of your arm and strength of body. To others it is feeling the flow of potential, gently guiding it towards the outcome desired. And there are those that lie to the world itself, tricking it into being something it is not. Personally, I like to think of the potential as a boulder resting on top of a hill that with great effort can be put into motion and start its descent. But be wary, lest the single rolling boulder turns into an uncontrollable landslide. This is why you must study diligently here at the Learned's Guild!_

Magic is the catch-all name given to acts using [Potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) outside the normal rules of the game and the game world. Many practitioners would not even consider themselves to be wielding magic, but rather perform miracles, invoke the favour of the gods, harness their innate abilities, or just be blessed with uncanny luck. The rules are the same though and for that purpose, these acts are all referred to as magic.    
   
>  _Though there are some practitioners that call themselves conjurers, it is not possible to create something out of nothing. For potential to be transformed, or rather act as a catalyst for transformation, there must be something it can act on. Just like my earth magic cannot create a castle without stones to form, fire magic cannot work without air in which it can combust in and frost magic cannot work without water in some form. Few are ever made aware of this true nature though, but they learn to bring extra water with them out into the desert lest their magic sucks the moisture from their own skins when they seemingly create ice out of thin air._

> _Unlike what my esteemed colleague Xax claim, it **is** possible to create something out of nothing, or at least out of pure potential. However, the process to do so starts with manifesting potential in the forms of agency, cognition, essence, or all three. Initially, these manifestations will be little more than mere illusions, but over time, as reality itself is tricked into believing in the illusions, they can become just as real as you and me._

## Aspects of Magic   
When creating a magical skill, consider what aspects of magic it encompasses. Can it cause harm, create illusions, move creatures and objects, or convey messages and sights?   
   
The more aspects a magical skill encompasses, the more versatile and hence powerful it becomes. This should be reflected in the cost in [Character Points](../Character%20Options/Character%20Points.md) that needs to be spent to advance a level in the skill in question.   
   
> _There are many views on what forms channeling the power of a nexus can take. To understand the one true nature of it is to forget and deny the other, equally true natures of it. Adhering to a singular truth is thus tantamount to denying potential itself. To me, this search for a true nature is akin to madness. Nevertheless, if it helps you on your path towards understanding, I will tell you of the most commonly acknowledged aspects of this thing you consider magic.   
>    
> There are seven of them. Three that are aspects of what can be affected. Four that are aspects of change. All of them joining in the act of transforming the potential of a nexus into a change of reality.   
>   
> The first three aspects are the aspects of what can be changed; **Agency**, **Cognition**, and **Essence**. These are always needed, but never used in isolation. Cognition pertains to thought and senses and thus enables other aspects to have an effect on the mind. Essence pertains to that which is - the concrete and the physical. It enables aspects to have an effect on the material. Agency allows potential itself to be manipulated.   
>   
> The four other aspects are **Formation**, **Manifestation**, **Portation**, and **Sunderance**. Formation is used to shape minds, matter, and fates, whereas Sunderance break and savage the very same. Portation move ideas, bodies, and fortunes. Lastly, Manifestation turn potential into existence. True creation takes time and discipline though, so most manifestations are little more than illusions. With enough effort, a manifestation can be made convincing enough to trick reality itself into that which has manifested actually exists!_

| Aspect        | Agency                   | Cognition                   | Essence                   |   
|:------------- |:------------------------ |:--------------------------- |:------------------------- |   
| Formation     | Aid ([bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md))         | Influence                   | Shape                     |   
| Manifestation | Create (illusory) agency | Create (illusory) cognition | Create (illusory) essence |   
| Portation     | Transfer [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md)       | Telepathy                   | Teleportation             |   
| Sunderance    | Hinder ([malus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Malus%20Dice.md))      | Cause mental damage         | Cause physical damage     |   
   
### Combining Aspects   
Spells can be made to require various levels of the aspects in order to be available to the actor to cast. For example, creating an illusion of a fierce warrior might only require the _obfuscation_ aspect, but making the illusory warrior capable of hurting those that are fooled by the illusion might also require a the _sunderance_ aspect. The same goes for a life stealing spell which could combine the aspects _conduction_ and _sunderance_ to both cause fatigue to a target and transfer some of its potential to the caster.     
   
> The _Kyreenian Sword School_ teaches a form of magic to its students called _Sword Dancing_. Its practitioners can enhance their blade's strikes and parries (_formation of agency_), move more swiftly across the battlefield (_portation of essence_), and make devastating melee and ranged attacks (_sunderance of essence_).   
   
> The magic of Naelasti, a member of the _Learned's Guild_, is centered around discovering and discerning the truth. As such she often uses illusions (_manifestation of essence_) to visualise the information she seeks (_formation and portation of cognition_).   
   
> Meister Xax, another member of the _Learned's Guild_ is not only a self-proclaimed great architect and master builder, but also a master of earth magic. He can encase an object in a protective crust (_formation of agency_), move the earth aside (_portation of essence_), and even shake the ground when enraged (_sunderance of essence_).   
   
## Character Point Cost of Magic and Aspects   
   
Magical skills are acquired at the same cost as mundane skills. However, in order to cast spells, it is necessary to understand the aspect or aspects involved in a given spell. For each level taken in a magical skill, it is possible to acquire an aspect for 5 character points.   
   
> A level 2 _Kyreenian Sword Dancer_ could acquire _agency_ and _formation_ for 10 points after having spent 3 points on the magical skill. This is 13 points in total for some minor boosts. Advancing to level 3 (+3 points) and grabbing _sunderance_ (+5 points) makes it a total of 21 character points for some moderately useful effects.   
   
> A war mage not caring for anything other than _essence_ and _sunderance_ could do some real damage by only spending 20-25 character points (level 4-5 + 10 points for _essence_ and  _sunderance_). They would be as much a one-trick-pony as an archer though.   
   
## Option: Aspectless Magic   
As an alternative to the aspects, a character could wield any kind of magic, only limited by what the player and gamemaster agrees on. If using this option, let magical skills cost twice as much as ordinary skill.
