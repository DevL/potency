A skill is the ability to perform certain tasks with some level of proficency. In _Potency_, skills also cover what in our RPG systems would use abilities or attributes for.   
   
Skills fall into two major categories: _mundane skills_ and [Magical Skills](../Skills/Magical%20Skills.md). Mundane skills are further grouped into five subcategories: [Combat Skills](../Skills/Combat%20Skills.md), [Intellectual Skills](../Skills/Intellectual%20Skills.md), [Physical Skills](../Skills/Physical%20Skills.md), [Practical Skills](../Skills/Practical%20Skills.md), and [Social Skills](../Skills/Social%20Skills.md). Common for all 25 mundane skills is that player characters have at least 1-2 [skill levels](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) in them, whereas only some have one or more [Magical Skills](../Skills/Magical%20Skills.md).
