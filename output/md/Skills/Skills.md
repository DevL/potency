A skill is the ability to perform certain tasks with some level of proficiency. In _Potency_, skills also cover what in our RPG systems would use abilities or attributes for.   
   
Skills fall into two major categories: _mundane skills_ and [aspects of magic](../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md). Mundane skills are further grouped into five subcategories: [Combat Skills](../Skills/Combat%20Skills.md), [Intellectual Skills](../Skills/Intellectual%20Skills.md), [Physical Skills](../Skills/Physical%20Skills.md), [Practical Skills](../Skills/Practical%20Skills.md), and [Social Skills](../Skills/Social%20Skills.md).    
   
Regardless of skill type, all player characterâ€™s start with a [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) of 1 (_untrained_) in all skills, mundane and magical.
