A skill is the ability to perform certain tasks with some level of proficiency. In _Potency_, skills also cover what in our RPG systems would use abilities or attributes for.   
   
Skills fall into two major categories: [mundane skills](../Skills/Mundane%20Skills.md) and [extraordinary skills](../Skills/Extraordinary%20Skills.md) which include, but are not limited to, [magical skills](../Magic/Magic.md).
