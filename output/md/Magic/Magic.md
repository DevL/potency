Magic and magical effects are composed of three components - [spell effect](../Magic/Effect.md), [spell range](../Magic/Range.md), and [spell volume](../Magic/Volume.md). From these [spell dice](../Magic/Spell%20Dice.md) and the required [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) are derived. Lastly, [spell difficulty](../Magic/Spell%20Difficulty.md) and [sustain](../Magic/Sustain.md) are derived from the *spell dice* property.
