Magic and magical effects are composed of three components - [Effect](../Magic/Effect.md), [Range](../Magic/Range.md), and [Volume](../Magic/Volume.md). From these three components other properties are derived - [Spell Dice](../Magic/Spell%20Dice.md), [Sustain](../Magic/Sustain.md), and Required Skill Level. Lastly, [Spell Difficulty](../Magic/Spell%20Difficulty.md) is derived from the *spell dice* property.
