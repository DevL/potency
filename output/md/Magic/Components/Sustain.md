The [potential](../../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) required on subsequent turns after casting a spell to keep its effect active, given that the magical effect allows it.    
   
Calculated as 2/3 of the number of [spell dice](../../Magic/Components/Spell%20Dice.md), rounded. The [trait](../../Character%20Options/Traits.md) _Sustainable Spells_ replaces this calculation with 1/2 of the number of [spell dice](../../Magic/Components/Spell%20Dice.md), rounded.   
   
Unless otherwise stated, no new skill roll is required to sustain a spell.
