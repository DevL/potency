The effect of the spell. Measured on a scale of 1-5 corresponding to 2D-6D and being called mundane, minor, medium, major, and massive respectively. The effect of 1-3 [bonus dice](../../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md)/[malus dice](../../Rolling%20Dice/Malus%20Dice.md) are considered minor, major, and massive respectively. In the case of transferring [potential](../../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) to or from the caster, the effect corresponds to the amount of [potential](../../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) that can be transferred.   
   
Note that as spells can combine several effects into one, it might be necessary for the gamemaster to adjucate the value of a spell’s effect or even require the desired magical effects to be cast as two different spells. Imposing [malus dice](../../Rolling%20Dice/Malus%20Dice.md) to a target’s _resistance_ and causing physical damage could in theory be constructed as a single spell using the [magical aspects](../../Magic/Aspects%20of%20Magic.md) _agency_, _essence_, and _sunderance_; but it would be prudent to instead split the effects into two different spells. One for imposing [malus dice](../../Rolling%20Dice/Malus%20Dice.md) and one for causing harm.

|   5    | massive     |     N/A     |         6D         |     5     |   
   
## Effects with Bonus Dice   
There are a few ways that a spell’s effect can gain [bonus dice](../../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md). When it comes to effects that require a [composed roll](../../Rolling%20Dice/Composing%20a%20Roll.md) to acheive something, e.g. a gust of wind blowing a foe over a cliff, add and use the [bonus dice](../../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) as normal. When it comes to other effects, the [bonus die](../../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) can instead be converted into a [potential](../../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) that is regained. Consider the magical effect to have required less effort than normal. Note that this does not reduce the number of [spell dice](../../Magic/Components/Spell%20Dice.md) and hence the [spell difficulty](../../Magic/Components/Spell%20Difficulty.md) or cost of [sustaining](../../Magic/Components/Sustain.md) the spell’s effect.
