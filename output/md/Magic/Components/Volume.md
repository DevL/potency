How much the spell effects. Measured on a scale of 1-5 corresponding to target, small, medium, large, and huge.   
   
What the various volumes mean depends on the effect of the spell. A huge daylight spell could easily illuminate a village without being overpowered whereas a huge fireball should be restricted to a courtyard or similar.
