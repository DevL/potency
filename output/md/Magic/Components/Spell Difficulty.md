alias: spell difficulty

The difficulty to cast the spell. Calculated as two times the number of [spell dice](../../Magic/Components/Spell%20Dice.md).   
   
Magic is high risk, high reward. As such, a [massive failure](../../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Failure.md) when casting a spell results in the caster sustaining a level of [fatigue](../../Conditions/Fatigue.md). However, a [massive success](../../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Success.md) grants a [fortune point](../../Rolling%20Dice/Fortune%20Points.md) just like a [mundane skill](../../Skills/Skills.md) roll.
