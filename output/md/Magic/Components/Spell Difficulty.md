alias: spell difficulty

The difficulty to cast the spell. Calculated as two times the number of [spell dice](../../Magic/Components/Spell%20Dice.md).   
   
Magic is high risk, high reward. As such, a [massive failure](../../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Failure.md) when casting a spell results in the caster sustaining a level of [fatigue](../../Conditions/Fatigue.md). However, a [massive success](../../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Success.md) adds a [bonus die](../../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) to the [spell effect](../../Magic/Components/Effect.md).
