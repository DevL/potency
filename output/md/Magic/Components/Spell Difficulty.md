The difficulty to cast the spell.    
   
Calculated as 2 * [Spell Dice](../../Magic/Components/Spell%20Dice.md).   
   
Magic is high risk, high reward. As such, a [massive failure](../../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Failure.md) when casting a spell results in the caster sustaining a level of [fatigue](../../Conditions/Fatigue.md).
