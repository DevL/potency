Magic and magical effects are composed of three components - [spell effect](../Magic/Components/Effect.md), [spell range](../Magic/Components/Range.md), and [spell volume](../Magic/Components/Volume.md). From these [spell dice](../Magic/Components/Spell%20Dice.md) and the required [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) are derived. Lastly, [spell difficulty](../Magic/Components/Spell%20Difficulty.md) and [sustain](../Magic/Components/Sustain.md) are derived from the *spell dice* property.

## Creating a Spell   
When creating a spell, consider what aspects of magic it encompasses. Can it cause harm, create illusions, move creatures and objects, or convey messages and sights?   
   
Spells can be made to require various levels of the aspects in order to be available to the actor to cast. For example, creating an illusion of a fierce warrior might only require the _manifestation_ and _essence_ aspects, but making the illusory warrior capable of hurting those that are fooled by the illusion might also require the _sunderance_ aspect. The same goes for a life stealing spell which could combine the aspects _agency_, _essence_, _portation_, and _sunderance_ to both cause fatigue to a target and transfer some of its potential to the caster.   
   
The more aspects a spell encompasses, the more versatile and hence powerful it becomes, but also more difficult to master. This is reflected by the casterâ€™s _lowest_ magical skill being used to cast the spell.   
   
> The _Kyreenian Sword School_ teaches a form of magic to its students called _Sword Dancing_. Its practitioners can enhance their blade's strikes and parries (_formation of agency_), move more swiftly across the battlefield (_portation of essence_), and make devastating melee and ranged attacks (_sunderance of essence_).   
   
> The magic of Naelasti, a member of the _Learned's Guild_, is centered around discovering and discerning the truth. As such she often uses illusions (_manifestation of essence_) to visualise the information she seeks (_formation and portation of cognition_).   
   
> Meister Xax, another member of the _Learned's Guild_ is not only a self-proclaimed great architect and master builder, but also a master of earth magic. He can encase an object in a protective crust (_formation of agency_), move the earth aside (_portation of essence_), and even shake the ground when enraged (_sunderance of essence_).
