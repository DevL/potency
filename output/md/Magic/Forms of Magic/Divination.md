**Target Aspects:** Cognition   
**Change Aspects:** Formation, Manifestation, Portation, Sunderance   
   
Through telepathy and scrying, the acquisition and conveyance of cognition is the realm of those practicing _divination_. The more sinister practitioners go further, attempting to control and sunder minds.   
   
## Opposed Willpower   
Anytime a spell involving the aspect of _cognition_ is targeted at an unwilling creature, the spell result needs to beat the target's _willpower_ to take effect.   
   
## Example Spells   
   
### Convey Cognition (C, P)   
Telepathically sharing emotions, sensations, thoughts, and visions.   
   
| Effect      | Fidelity of Cognition             |   
|:----------- |:--------------------------------- |   
| Mundane (1) | An emotion or a single word       |   
| Minor (2)   | A few words                       |   
| Medium (3)  | A few sentences or a single sense |   
| Major (4)   | A continuous conversation         |   
| Massive (5) | Fully shared senses and thoughts  |   
   
### Far Sight (C, M, P)   
By manifesting cognition somewhere else and through portation conveying what it perceives, a diviner can sense and see things from afar. [Volume](../../Magic/Components/Volume.md) represents the physical volume that can be perceived.    
   
| Effect      | Fidelity of Cognition            |   
|:----------- |:-------------------------------- |   
| Mundane (1) | Motion                           |   
| Minor (2)   | Hearing or smell                 |   
| Medium (3)  | Sight                            |   
| Major (4)   | Multiple senses                  |   
| Massive (5) | Fully shared senses and thoughts |   
   
### Influence (C, F)   
A form of mind control, but without sharing any senses. Instead, the given instructions are performed by the target to the best of their abilities as long as the spell is sustained.   
   
| Effect      | Extent of Control                       | Example                             |   
|:----------- |:--------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------- |   
| Mundane (1) | Instill harmless emotion                | "Hunger!"                           |   
| Minor (2)   | Single harmless instruction             | "Go eat!"                           |   
| Medium (3)  | Single harmful instruction              | "Eat this rotten meat!"             |   
| Major (4)   | Several harmful instructions            | "Attack your friend!"               |   
| Massive (5) | Detailed, complex, harmful instructions | "Steal the map and bring it to me." |   
   
   
### Mind Control (C, F, P)   
Taking control of another creature requires a greater [spell effect](../../Magic/Components/Effect.md) than _Influence_ as the target's senses are conveyed to the caster.   
   
| Effect      | Extent of Control                             | Example                           |   
|:----------- |:--------------------------------------------- |:--------------------------------- |   
| Medium (3)  | Shared senses, but no control                 | Seeing through someone's eyes.    |   
| Major (4)   | Partial control, with shared senses           | Making the victim attack an ally. |   
| Massive (5) | Full control, with shared senses and thoughts | Complete control over the victim. |   
   
### Shatter Mind (C, S)   
Combining _sunderance_ with _cognition_ allows ranged, mental damage to be dealt to the target. The [spell effect](../../Magic/Components/Effect.md) against the target's _willpower_ determine the amount of [fatigue](../../Conditions/Fatigue.md) the target sustains.   
   
| Effect      | Mental Damage including Wild Die |   
|:----------- |:-------------------------------- |   
| Mundane (1) | 2D                               |   
| Minor (2)   | 3D                               |   
| Medium (3)  | 4D                               |   
| Major (4)   | 5D                               |   
| Massive (5) | 6D                               |
