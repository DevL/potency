One of the most difficult forms of magic is to convert raw potential into that which not only exists, but also acts in accordance with oneâ€™s will. Just manifesting a thinking being with its own agency is not enough because the summoned creature must have its mind bent to do the conjurers bidding.   
   
Lesser forms of conjuration does away with aspect of essence by using carcasses and constructs that are receptible to a conjured mind. This form of conjuration is in principle necromancy.    
   
An even more reduced form of conjuration is practiced by illusionists, that conjure more or less believable manifestations, controlling them like puppeteers.
