**Target Aspects:** Agency   
**Change Aspects:** Formation, Manifestation, Portation, Sunderance   
   
Manipulating chance, possibility, and potentiality is the domain of fate weavers.   
   
## Opposed Willpower   
Anytime a spell involving the aspect of _agency_ is targeted at an unwilling creature, the spell result needs to beat the target's _willpower_ to take effect.   
   
## Example Spells   
   
### Assistance (A, F)   
There are many variations of this spell, each granting bonus dice to one or more rolls as long as the spell is sustained. For example, a protective spell might grant bonus dice to the target's _defence_ or _willpower_ rolls depending on the nature of the protection - physical or mental. Silencing someone's steps might boost _stealth_ rolls. Be sure to note what rolls can be assisted.    
   
If multiple bonus dice are granted, they may be distributed over multiple types of rolls.   
   
| Effect     | Bonus Dice |   
|:---------- | ----------:|   
| Minor (2)  |          1 |   
| Medium (3) |          2 |   
| Major (4)  |          3 |   
   
### Hinderance (A, S)   
Hindering an unwilling target requires beating the target's _willpower_ with the spell result.    
   
There are many variations of this spell, each imposing malus dice to one or more rolls as long as the spell is sustained. For example, a distraction spell might grant malus dice to the target's _melee combat_, _ranged combat_, or _unarmed combat_ rolls. Making someone clumsy might hinder _movement_ rolls. Be sure to note what rolls can be affected.   
   
If multiple malus dice are imposed, they may be distributed over multiple types of rolls.   
   
| Effect     | Malus Dice |   
|:---------- | ----------:|   
| Minor (2)  |          1 |   
| Medium (3) |          2 |   
| Major (4)  |          3 |   
   
### Steal Potential (A, P, S)   
Stealing potential from an unwilling target requires beating the target's _willpower_ with the spell result. However, it does have the benefit of increasing the caster's potential at the expense of an opponent's potential. Since stealing potential involves not only the target but also the caster, the minimum required [spell volume](../../Magic/Components/Volume.md) is 2. Increasing the [spell volume](../../Magic/Components/Volume.md) allows stealing potential from multiple targets, but the total amount of potential stolen is distributed over the targets as the caster wishes.   
   
| Effect      | Potential |   
|:----------- | ---------:|   
| Mundane (1) |         1 |   
| Minor (2)   |         2 |   
| Medium (3)  |         3 |   
| Major (4)   |         4 |   
| Massive (5) |         5 |   
   
### Transfer Potential (A, P)   
Between [spell volume](../../Magic/Components/Volume.md) number of willing participants (minimum 2), potential can be transferred. This can either be between the caster and one or more targets, or between a number of targets other than the caster. The amount of potential transferred is distributed between the participants as the caster wishes.   
   
| Effect      | Potential |   
|:----------- | ---------:|   
| Mundane (1) |         1 |   
| Minor (2)   |         2 |   
| Medium (3)  |         3 |   
| Major (4)   |         4 |   
| Massive (5) |         5 |
