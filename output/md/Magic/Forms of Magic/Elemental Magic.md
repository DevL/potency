## Example Spells   
   
### Elemental Burst (E, S)   
Combining _sunderance_ with _essence_ allows physical damage to be dealt to the target. The spell result is used against the target's _defence_ to determine if the target is hit and the spell effect against the target's _resistance_ determine the amount of [wounds](../../Conditions/Conditions.md) the target sustains.
