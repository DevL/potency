This is a special condition caused by other conditions. Being knocked-out means that an actor is incapable of performing any actions or reactions and their potential is considered to be 0.   
   
If a knocked-out actor needs to make an opposed roll, it results in an automatic [forced passive value](../Rolling%20Dice/Forced%20Passive%20Value.md) based on 0P, but including any applicable [bonus](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) or [malus](../Rolling%20Dice/Malus%20Dice.md) dice.   
   
There are a number of ways of being _knocked-out_.    
   
1. An actorâ€™s [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) is reduced to 0P. Note that is **not** caused by using all potential during a round, but rather when the amount of potential that is renewed each round reaches 0P.   
2. An actor sustains more [wounds](../Conditions/Wound.md) than their knocked-out threshold allows. For player characters this is typically 5.   
3. An actor sustains more [fatigue](../Conditions/Fatigue.md) than their knocked-out threshold allows. For player characters this is typically 5.
