aliases: knocked-out, knock-out, knock-out threshold

This is a special condition caused by other conditions. Being knocked-out means that an actor is incapable of performing any actions or reactions and their potential is considered to be 0.   
   
If a knocked-out actor needs to make an opposed roll, it results in an automatic [forced passive value](../Rolling%20Dice/Forced%20Passive%20Value.md) based on 0P, but including any applicable [bonus](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) or [malus](../Rolling%20Dice/Malus%20Dice.md) dice.   
   
There are a number of ways of being _knocked-out_.    
   
1. An actorâ€™s [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) is reduced to 0P. Note that is **not** caused by using all potential during a round, but rather when the amount of potential that is renewed each round reaches 0P.   
2. An actor sustains more [wounds](../Conditions/Wound.md) than their knock-out threshold allows.   
3. An actor sustains more [fatigue](../Conditions/Fatigue.md) than their knock-out threshold allows.   
4. An actor sustains a combination of [fatigue](../Conditions/Fatigue.md) or [wounds](../Conditions/Wound.md) that exceeds their knock-out threshold.   
   
## Knock-Out Threshold   
For player characters, this is typically 6, but some [traits](../Character%20Options/Traits.md) can increase or decrease it slightly. For other actors, see [morale](../Gamemaster%20Tools/Morale.md).
