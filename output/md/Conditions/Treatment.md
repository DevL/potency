Some [conditions](../Conditions/Conditions.md) require being treated before the [recovery](../Conditions/Recovery.md) process can begin, usually with the [skill](/not_created.md) _healing_. The most common conditions that need treatment are [wounds](../Conditions/Wound.md), though various poisons and toxins easily can require antidotes.   
   
To treat someoneâ€™s wounds, make a _healing_ roll against 5 times the number of wounds sustained, though at most 25.    
   
Instead of awarding a [fortune point](../Rolling%20Dice/Fortune%20Points.md), a [massive success](../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Success.md) not only treats the condition, enabling [recovery](../Conditions/Recovery.md), but it also decreases the severity of the condition by one degree. Conversely, a [massive failure](../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Failure.md) aggrevates the condition by one degree of severity instead of awarding a [fortune point](../Rolling%20Dice/Fortune%20Points.md).   
   
Once a condition has been treated successfully, no additional benefits can come from treating it again. However, if a condition for any reason is aggrevated by a degree or more, it needs treatment again to enable further [recovery](../Conditions/Recovery.md).
