_Recovery_ is the amount of rest taken in order to remove a [condition](../Conditions/Conditions.md). Some [conditions](../Conditions/Conditions.md) require [treatment](../Conditions/Treatment.md) before a [recovery](../Conditions/Recovery.md) process can be started.    
   
Depending on the type of condition and its severity, different time scales are used to determine how long an actor needs to rest in order to reduce a conditionâ€™s severity by one degree and ultimately remove it all together.   
   
| Condition   | Time Scale                |   
| -------- | ------------------------- |   
| fatigue     | 1 hour/degree of severity. |   
| wound       | 1 day/degree of severity.  |   
| knocked-out | Depends on underlying conditions.                        |
