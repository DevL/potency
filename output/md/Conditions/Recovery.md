aliases: recovery, recovered

Comes in three versions: _quick_, _normal_, and _extended_. Each comes in three time scales, 1-3. To recover from [conditions](../Conditions/Conditions.md) that require recovery, combine the grade of the condition with the type of recovery required to find out what time scale to use.    
   
```
FIXME - rework the notion of conditions with grades/degrees/levels.
Remove quick recovery and have five levels each for the remaining?
Or make it so that a single degree is recovered per fixed time unit?

E.g. a degree of fatigue could take an hour's worth of rest to recover from making a good night's sleep enough to clear all fatigue sustained. A wound could take a day making it about a week's worth of rest to recover from being knocked-out by wounds.
