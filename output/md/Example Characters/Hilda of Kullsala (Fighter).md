Hailing from the rural town of Kullsala, Hilda was once part of its proud militia, but she has since left it to seek adventure in the wider world. Most of Hilda’s life has been spent on acquiring the practical skills needed to live, survive, and thrive in the countryside of Brechten. Hilda’s small stature makes her harder to hit, but it also imposes limits on her physical strength. Through extensive physical training she has overcome a lot of the relative frailty common among halflings and she won the town running championship three years in a row.    
   
In combat Hilda wields the same winged spear she used in the militia. It is shorter than most spears in order to be effectively used by a halfling, but just as deadly as any other. Hanging from her belt is a dagger and a small pouch containing the sling and its small steel balls that she never fully mastered despite being given it at a young age from her father. For protection, she wears her worn, but still serviceable militia brigandine.   
   
Her dagger is a light melee weapon and the sling is a light ranged weapon, both adding 1B of physical damage. Her spear, when gripped with both hands, adds 2D physical damage.   
   
Her militia brigandine is a light armour, giving her 1B *Resistance* (*Armoured(1)*) at the cost of 1P (_Encumbered(1)_).   
   
With her modest life savings and a decent amount of provisions in her backpack, Hilda leaves Kullsala and walks the roads towards An’Taghel, the capital of the barony of Brechten.
