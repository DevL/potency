**For the GM**   
Bonus dice represent any form of advantage that has been obtained when performing a task. It offers an alternative to lowering the difficulty of the task being performed. For example, if an archer has taken up position on a roof and starts loosing arrows down on her foes below, give her a bonus die. If the guards also are unaware of her being up there, make that two or even three bonus dice!
