**For the GM**   
Malus dice represents any form of hindrance that the player's encounter when performing a task. It is an alternative to raising the difficulty of a task. For example, freeing oneself when bound by ropes might be considered a difficult task with a difficulty of 18. If the actor attempting to do this _also_ has been wounded in the shoulder, things might be harder. Instead of raising the difficulty, give the actor a malus dice or two to represent this extra hindrance.
