## Determining Success or Failure   
Compare the result of an [active or passive](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md) roll against the difficulty.   
   
| Roll Type | Roll vs Difficulty | Result          |   
|:--------- |:------------------ |:--------------- |   
| Active    | 10 or more lower   | Massive Failure |   
| Active    | 1-9 lower          | Failure         |   
| Active    | 0-9 over           | Success         |   
| Active    | 10 or more over    | Massive Success |   
| Passive   | 0 or more lower    | Failure         |   
| Passive   | 1 or more over     | Success         |   
   
## Additional Effects of Success or Failure   
Most of the time, the effects of succeeding or failing a particular roll are obvious or can be determined by the gamemaster. However, some rolls have additional effects applied depending on what kind of roll is made and the degree of success or failure acheived.
