When lending aid, an actor performs some action with a difficulty determined by the gsmemaster.   
   
Lending aid cost 2P for 1B. If multiple actors lend aid, The second actor can spend 3P for 1B, and a third actor can spend 4P for 1B. Having more than three assistants grants no additional benefits, though it might be required to even undertake the task or be given aid in the first place.
