An actor can spend potential to assist another actor in its efforts, given that the circumstances allow it. The gamemaster will determine if an actor can aid another actor.   
   
When lending aid, an actor performs some action with a difficulty determined by the gamemaster. If successful, the actor being helped receives 1B to their roll.   
   
If multiple actors lend aid, subsequent helping actors need to make more difficulty rolls, and preferably different rolls.   
   
> Having three friends all using _exertion_ to help you push the same boulder down on an bandit encampment is not quite as fun as having one of them using _devices_ to rig a lever, another _crafting_ to perfect the lever, and only having the third to add their strength using _exertion_ is arguably more fun.   
   
Having more than three assistants grants no additional benefits, though it might be required to even undertake the task or be given aid in the first place.
