aliases: passive values, passive values
---
   
The passive value is used when no potential is spent on making an [active roll](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md), yet a result needs to be obtained, e.g. for setting a difficulty for another actor performing an [active roll](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md).   
   
To calculate a passive value, first [compose a roll](../Rolling%20Dice/Composing%20a%20Roll.md) as if the maximum allowed [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) was used. The [wild die](../Rolling%20Dice/Wild%20Die.md) and any normal dice are worth 3 each, with [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) being worth 2 each. [Malus Dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Malus%20Dice.md) negate first [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) and then normal dice as usual.   
   
If the composed roll ends up consisting of only the [wild die](../Rolling%20Dice/Wild%20Die.md), treat the passive value as 5.
