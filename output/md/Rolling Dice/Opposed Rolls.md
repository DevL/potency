An opposed roll is a roll where two [actors](../Rolling%20Dice/Actors.md) make rolls against one another to determine a result rather than a single actor trying to beat a difficulty determined by the gamemaster.   
   
One [actor](../Rolling%20Dice/Actors.md) is always making an [active roll](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md) whereas the other actor is making a [reaction](../Rolling%20Dice/Actions%20and%20Reactions.md) roll that can be either [active](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md) or [passive](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md).
