alias: forced passive value

In order to make an [active roll](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md), at least 2P must be spent by an [actor](../Rolling%20Dice/Actors.md). If this cannot be done, the roll becomes a [passive roll](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md).   
   
This means that anyone with a [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) of 1 (_untrained_) must spend 2P to make an [active roll](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md), but cannot use more than 1P to [compose the roll](../Rolling%20Dice/Composing%20a%20Roll.md).   
   
```
The reason behind this rule is to avoid too many dice rolls being made by actors with large amounts of potential.
