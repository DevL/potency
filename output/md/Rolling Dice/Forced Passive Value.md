alias: forced passive value

Any composed roll not involving at least 2P becomes a [passive roll](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md). Even having one or moreÂ [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) does not change this. This means that anyone with a [skill level](../Skills/Skill%20Level.md) of 1 (_untrained_) **cannot** make an [active roll](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md).   
   
```
The reason behind this rule is to avoid too many dice rolls being made by actors with large amounts of potential.
