alias: forced passive value

Any composed roll not involving at least 2P becomes a passive roll. Even havingÂ [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) does not change this.   
   
```
The reason behind this rule is to avoid too many dice rolls being made by actors with large amounts of potential.
