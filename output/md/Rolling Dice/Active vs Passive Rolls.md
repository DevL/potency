Sometimes an [actor](../Rolling%20Dice/Actors.md) cannot or does not want to expend [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) on a [composed roll](../Rolling%20Dice/Composing%20a%20Roll.md). In those situations, the roll can be made _passively_ instead of _actively_. A _passive_ roll uses the [passive value](../Rolling%20Dice/Passive%20Value.md) for the roll rather than dice.
