During their [turn](../Game%20Modes/Turns.md), an [actor](../Rolling%20Dice/Actors.md) can perform _actions_ by spending [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md). Other actors can perform _reactions_ using their [potential](../Rolling%20Dice/Potential.md) if they are affected by an _action_.    
   
> Draggomir performs an action during his turn by smashing his hammer against the bandit using the _melee combat_ skill. The bandit can react by making a _defence_ roll to avoid being hit. As it is not the bandit's turn, the bandit cannot perform other actions.
