A fortune point can be spent _before_ any roll to gain a [bonus die](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md) or _after_ a roll to re-roll it. The result of the re-roll stands.   
   
Multiple fortune points cannot be spent on the same roll to gain multiple [bonus dice](../Rolling%20Dice/Bonus%20Dice.md), and only one re-roll is possible.   
   
A [massive success](../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Success.md) or a [massive failure](../Rolling%20Dice/Massive%20Failure.md) when making an [active](../Rolling%20Dice/Active%20vs%20Passive%20Rolls.md) [mundane skill](../Skills/Skills.md) roll awards the character a fortune point. Fortune points cannot be gained this way from re-rolls or from _effect_ rolls such as causing or resisting mental or physical damage.
