Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all dice rolls include a special die called the _wild die_. If it comes up as a 2 to 5 it is treates as any other dice. However, if it comes up as a 1 it _implodes_ and if it comes up as a 6 it _explodes_.   
   
## Imploding Wild Die   
An imploding wild die is counted as a 0. In addition, the higheat other dice is removed from the roll result.   
   
## Exploding Wild Die   
An exploding wild die is treated as a 6. In addition it is rolled again. A 1 to 5 on subsequent rolls are added to the roll result whereas a 6 is added, but then the wild dice is rolled again.
